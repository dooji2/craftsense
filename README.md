# CraftSense

**CraftSense** is a Minecraft mod that helps players with crafting by predicting and suggesting crafting recipes based on their previous crafting habits. The mod analyzes items in the playerâ€™s inventory, recommends possible crafting recipes and allows for instant crafting by simply clicking on the suggested output to make the crafting process faster and easier. It can be enabled or disabled with a customizable keybind (**K** by default), allowing you to easily toggle it on or off.

**Requires Fabric API. Also compatible with NeoForge, using Sintrya Connector, requires Forgified Fabric API.**
