# CraftSense

**CraftSense** is a Minecraft mod that helps players with crafting by predicting and suggesting crafting recipes based on their previous crafting habits. The mod analyzes items in the playerâ€™s inventory, then recommends possible crafting recipes to make the crafting process faster and easier. It can be enabled or disabled with a customizable keybind (**K** by default), allowing you to easily toggle it on or off.
